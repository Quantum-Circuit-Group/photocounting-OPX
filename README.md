# Number-resolved photocounter for propagating microwave mode

This repository contains the code of the pulse sequences used to generate the data for the article (currently available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05114)).

The `config.py` file contains all the intermediate frequencies, DC bias, demodulation functions and pulse definitions used in the other programs.
